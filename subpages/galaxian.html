                A capstone project for my Computer Graphics course. We were tasked with creating a simple version of the classic Galaxian video game, applying the skills
                we learned in the course in WebGL programming. Unfortunately, I believe it would violate some university policies to include the actual project, but I may check
                with my instructors since it wouldn't be difficult and would make for a more effective demo than a screenshot.

            <p>
                The main motivation for this project was as a capstone assessment for the skills learned in the graphics course. However, game development is the spark that got me 
                interested in computer science initially, and it would be a lie to say I didn't take to this project with some extra passion. I enjoyed the 'game engine design' aspects
                of this project immensely, more so than the graphics and rendering.

                I got a solid grade on this project, and I really enjoyed working on it. The few twists and quality of life features/effects I added, including the score/round counters,
                explosions, and enemy animation effects, as well as the difficulty ramp-up, were a lot of fun to come up with and hardcode in. I think the final result 
                is at the least playable, and maybe even a bit fun. It demonstrates a solid understanding of computer graphics and the basics of how to structure
                a game in code.
