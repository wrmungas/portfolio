                You're on it! I'm creating a website as a portfolio to list my projects, so that future employers can look at some evidence of my skill.
                I would say developing the website also counts as a project of its own, and since it's my website I get to make that decision!
            </p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Why</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="project-description"">
            <p>
                So that potential employers can see some evidence of my experience (and how awesome I am). Doing a project like this was heavily recommended by people I have 
                talked to in industry in the course of seeking employment. I also figure this is a good way to learn more about web pages and programming.

                This is a solo project made purely for practical future use; it is (as you may have noticed) not yet complete, and really it won't ever be. As I work on
                further projects I will update this site to include them. This project has been a good test of my ability to get something up and running quickly, and I have 
                learned a bit more about HTML and CSS. I may look at adding more dynamic functionality with JavaScript in the future, and maybe hosting the website with a dedicated
                server PC (or maybe a cheap laptop - it's not like this is particularly computationally heavy); but for now simply having a site up with
                working and complete pages for each project is the goal.
