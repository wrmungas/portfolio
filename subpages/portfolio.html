                You're on it! I'm creating a website as a portfolio to list my projects, so that future employers can look at some evidence of my skill.
                I would say developing the website also counts as a project of its own.
            </p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Why</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="project-description"">
            <p>
                So that employers can see some evidence of my experience (and how awesome I am).
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Results</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="project-description"">
            <p>
                This is a solo project made out for practical future use; it is (as you may have noticed) not yet complete, and as I do more projects I will 
                of course add to it.
