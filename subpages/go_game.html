        <p>
            I am creating a simple desktop application for playing the game of Go, written entirely in C with the SDL library for rendering. 
            Both Go and the C programming language are close to my heart, so I decided it would be interesting to try and combine the two. 
            Features I hope to implement include: simple pass-play on the same computer; saving and editing games; and as a reach goal, eventual 
            support for the standard SGF file format and online play with the KGS server.

        <p>
            I have been an avid amateur Go player since the pandemic, when I watched the AlphaGo documentary and was introduced to this 
            unique game. I was captivated by it for a few reasons. I found the game bizarre, abstract, and beautiful. From very simple rules
            arose a game of immense emergent complexity - for computers to reliably beat human professionals took such major advancements in deep 
            learning that they directly led to the modern AI revolution. It is the oldest continually played game in human history, and has a rich 
            set of traditions and philosophies to go (ha) with that legacy. Once I had learned the rules and played a few games against bots online, 
            I acquired a physical set and began playing with my brothers. Later I progressed to more serious online play. I am now into the single 
            digit kyu ranks (for those unfamiliar, a medium skill level solid for an amateur to attain) on the servers, and I am still actively playing, learning, 
            and progressing.

            This is a solo passion project that I am developing on my own time outside of school, and I may not reach all of my goals - but I would certainly like to!
            This is an ongoing project in very early stages, and I have even restarted once; but I have made it at least to opening a window with SDL and the tackling 
            game representation in the code. I am also learning to use AI suggestions to speed development and get much of the boilerplate code for running such
            an application out of the way.
