        <h1>Coffee Maker</h1>

        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>
            In the fall semester of 2024 I took CSC 326, the required Software Engineering course for computer science majors at 
            NCSU. Throughout the course students learned about skills beyond programming for problem-solving. The course focused
            on full-stack application development, especially elements of proper design and management. Students worked on a single
            project throughout the semester, first individually/as partners and then in larger teams. This project was an example application, a mockup
            of an online coffee ordering service.
        </p>

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
            By developing Coffee Maker we as students gained experience with Agile development cycles and rapid iteration. Teams
            participated in sprints to work on features in batches, moving through phases of design, implementation, and testing. We
            also picked up some familiarity with new technologies: the project used React JS for frontend, and a MySQL server for a database,
            both of which were completely unknown to most of us (myself included). Students also had to become familiar with how each of these
            parts of the application stack communicated with the backend.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> 
            I had the luck to partner with Jake Grigg, who was already experienced with backend and API development. We were able to split the work
            according to our strengths. My main focus was frontend design and implementation: I designed the website in wireframes, and 
            then proceeded to implement most of the webpages and their functionality with React. At the start of the fall semester JavaScript was 
            completely new to me; between this project and a webgl-based computer graphics course I became decently experienced with it by the end.
            Our project scored very well as we were able to implement many optional features for extra credit.
